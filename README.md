# Quote Display App

This is a simple web app that displays a random quote from a list of quotes.

## Features

- Displays a random quote and author each time the page loads.
- Quotes are stored in an array and can be updated.

## How to Add a Quote

To add a new quote to the app, follow these steps:

1. **Create a GitHub Issue**: Open the [issues page](https://github.com/your-repository/issues) of this repository.
2. **Submit a Quote**: In the issue description, provide the quote text and the author
3. **Review & Approval**: Once the quote is submitted, it will be reviewed, and upon approval, it will be added to the quotes array in the code.

## How It Works

- The app picks a random quote from the `quotes` array and displays it on the page each time it is loaded.
- The quote is displayed along with the author's name.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by submitting new quotes through issues or making improvements to the code!
